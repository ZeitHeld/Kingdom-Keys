Changed:
- **Pauldrons functionality changed completely:**
  * All armour can now be summoned via pauldron
  * Pauldrons now have an inventory with the 4 armour slots accessible by right clicking while holding it
  * Armour that takes damage while summoned will also take damage within the pauldron and therefore can break
  * Armour can be summoned without filling all 4 slots
